- Configured refinement stages (Needs Clarification → Ready for Sprint)

### 📚 Confluence  
- Living documentation: team agreements, architecture, APIs, decisions  
- Linked directly to Jira tickets for context  
- Sprint goals, retrospectives, FAQs, onboarding materials

### 🧠 Miro  
- Remote workshops (story mapping, team charter, retrospectives)  
- Interactive planning boards  
- Visual workflows and brainstorming spaces

### 📊 Power BI

## Agile Frameworks I Apply

### 🔁 Scrum  
I guide teams through all key Scrum events:
- Daily Standups  
- Sprint Planning  
- Sprint Reviews  
- Retrospectives  
- Multi-phase Backlog Refinement (Pre-Planning 1, 2 & Final Planning)

### 📈 Kanban  
When continuous flow is a better fit (e.g., Ops, Bug Teams, Support Squads), I use Kanban boards:
- WIP limits  
- Cycle time analysis  
- Lead time tracking  
- Visualized policies and blocked ticket alerts

### 🧩 SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)  
For enterprise environments:
- PI Planning (Program Increments)  
- Cross-team coordination  
- Aligning Features and Epics to Business Objectives  
- Supporting ARTs and Value Streams

## Agile Coaching & Team Enablement

### 🗣️ Feedback Loops  
- I run team health checks and collect feedback at every retrospective  
- Facilitate safe spaces to raise concerns and suggest improvements  
- Adapt ceremonies and tooling based on what works best for each squad

### 🌱 Coaching Style  
- Foster psychological safety  
- Promote self-organization and servant leadership  
- Encourage technical excellence through definition of done and peer reviews  
- Support POs with backlog shaping and stakeholder communication

### 🤝 Supporting Stakeholders  
- Build dashboards tailored to each audience (POs, managers, demand leads)  
- Run pre-planning alignment meetings with Product and Delivery  
- Increase trust through delivery transparency and proactive risk surfacing
