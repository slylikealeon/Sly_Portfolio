# 📊 Agile Metrics – Measuring What Matters

As a Scrum Master, I use metrics not to "control" teams, but to uncover opportunities for improvement, surface blockers, and create transparency between delivery and business impact.

This document outlines the core metrics I use, how I present them, and the mindset behind interpreting them.

---

## 🎯 Guiding Principles

- **No metric should be used to punish.** Metrics should spark conversations, not fear.
- **Context matters.** Numbers tell part of the story — interpretation is key.
- **Trends > Snapshots.** One bad sprint doesn’t mean failure. Patterns are what matter.
- **Visuals help alignment.** I use dashboards, graphs, and colors to help teams and stakeholders focus on what’s important.

## 📏 Key Metrics I Use

### 1. **Sprint Health**
A real-time snapshot of the current sprint’s progress. I use a custom Sprint Health dashboard that highlights:

| Dimension             | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| % of work completed   | Is the team progressing steadily or falling behind?                     |
| Scope change (added)  | Is work being introduced mid-sprint?                                   |
| Blockers present      | Are there flagged or stalled items?                                    |
| Work distribution     | Is the workload balanced across the team?                              |
| Focus factor          | Ratio of committed vs delivered work                                   |
| Story readiness       | Are there stories in sprint not meeting DoR?                           |

> I review Sprint Health daily in stand-ups and midway through the sprint in team check-ins.

### 2. **Velocity**
- Measures the amount of work delivered per sprint (usually in story points).
- Used to track team rhythm, not compare teams.
- Helps forecast future capacity.

> 🔍 I track **velocity trends** over multiple sprints, rather than single-point measures.

---

### 3. **Burndown / Burnup Charts**
- Visualize progress toward sprint or epic goals.
- Highlight scope creep, unfinished work, or slow starts.
- Easy to share in Sprint Reviews and daily syncs.

> 📌 I often compare **planned vs actual** lines to discuss commitment vs reality.

---

### 4. **Cycle Time**
- Time from "In Progress" to "Done".
- Helps understand delivery speed and efficiency.
- Useful for identifying blockers or review bottlenecks.

---

### 5. **Work in Progress (WIP)**
- Number of items actively being worked on.
- Excessive WIP often leads to context switching and unfinished stories.

> 💡 I support teams in setting **WIP limits** and visualizing them on Kanban boards.

---

### 6. **Blocked Issues & Flags**
- Track how often and how long issues are blocked.
- I surface flagged items daily and raise them in retrospectives to resolve root causes.

---

### 7. **Bug Trends / Defect Leakage**
- Bugs reported during and after a sprint.
- Focus is on understanding causes (e.g., unclear acceptance criteria, lack of tests).

> 🎯 Quality over speed. Fewer bugs = more sustainable delivery.

## 📊 How I Present Metrics

### 🔹 For Teams
- Simple dashboards in Jira to show sprint health
- Trends in velocity, WIP, blockers
- Retrospective charts to reflect and improve
- Sprint Health gadget in Jira with color-coded statuses

### 🔸 For Stakeholders / Delivery Managers
- Epic progress and burnup
- Delivery vs commitment
- High-level KPIs on roadmap features
- Power BI for cross-team insights and PI tracking

## ⚠️ Common Anti-Patterns I Actively Avoid

| Misuse                             | My Approach                                   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Using velocity to compare teams    | Educate leadership; focus on team baselines   |
| Gaming the numbers                 | Shift focus to outcomes and user value        |
| Obsessing over 100% completion     | Embrace learning, re-planning, and transparency |
| Ignoring soft signals              | Combine quantitative and qualitative feedback |

## ✅ How Metrics Drive Improvement

I always link metrics back to **actionable improvements**, such as:

- Reducing blockers → faster cycle time  
- Refining scope → better sprint predictability  
- Limiting WIP → more focus and less rework  
- Visualizing goals → team engagement and ownership  
- Monitoring sprint health → course-correcting mid-sprint when needed

## 🧠 Final Thought

Metrics are a compass — not a map. My job is to help the team and the organization use them to navigate, inspect, and adapt — not to fixate on perfection, but to move forward with purpose.
