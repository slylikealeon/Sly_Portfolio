# üïí Scrum Meeting Rhythm

As a Scrum Master, one of my key responsibilities is to design and support a meeting cadence that promotes alignment, focus, and sustainable delivery ‚Äî without overloading the team. Below is the structure I typically use with Scrum teams, along with the purpose, timing, and tips for each event.

## üóìÔ∏è Sprint Cadence Overview

| Event                        | Frequency         | Duration      | Participants               | Goal                                                |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Scrum                 | Daily             | 15 min        | Dev Team, SM               | Share progress, surface blockers                    |
| Sprint Planning ‚Äì Part 1    | Once per sprint   | 1 hour        | Dev Team, PO, SM           | Estimate & clarify candidate stories                |
| Sprint Planning ‚Äì Part 2    | Once per sprint   | 45 min        | Dev Team, PO, SM           | Finalize sprint backlog & define sprint goal        |
| Backlog Refinement          | 1‚Äì2x per sprint   | 1 hour each   | Dev Team, PO, SM           | Groom upcoming stories, clarify acceptance criteria |
| Sprint Review               | Once per sprint   | 1 hour        | Team, PO, Stakeholders     | Demo delivered work, gather feedback                |
| Retrospective               | Once per sprint   | 1 hour        | Dev Team, SM               | Reflect and identify improvements                   |

## üîÅ Pre-Planning Breakdown (Phased Refinement Approach)

When scope is unclear or the backlog needs alignment, I use a 3-part planning approach:

### 1. **Pre-Planning Part 1: Estimation & Exploration**
- Purpose: Rough estimation, initial understanding, raise questions.
- Output: Prioritized list of stories that need refinement.
- Tip: Use Planning Poker, T-Shirt sizes, or Dot Voting for engagement.

### 2. **Pre-Planning Part 2: Deep Refinement**
- Purpose: Clarify dependencies, acceptance criteria, and technical needs.
- Output: Stories that meet the Definition of Ready (DoR).
- Tip: Pair Dev + QA + PO in micro-breakout groups for tricky items.

### 3. **Pre-Planning Part 3: Final Sprint Planning**
- Purpose: Lock the sprint backlog, align on sprint goal.
- Output: Sprint commitment with confident, testable stories.
- Tip: Use Miro or Jira boards to visualize team commitment.

## üéØ My Role as Scrum Master in Each Ceremony

| Event             | How I Support                                                   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Scrum      | Timebox strictly, encourage peer-to-peer updates, watch for blockers. |
| Planning         | Facilitate with clear criteria, guard against overcommitment.   |
| Refinement       | Drive clarity using BDD, INVEST, and visual tools (e.g., Miro). |
| Review           | Coach team on how to present; ensure feedback loops are active. |
| Retrospective    | Rotate formats (Start-Stop-Continue, 4Ls, Mad/Sad/Glad); keep psychological safety high. |

## ‚úÖ Tips for Keeping Meetings Efficient

- Set expectations: Each event has a clear goal and owner.
- Timebox rigorously.
- Avoid multitasking and role confusion (SM ‚â† PO ‚â† PM).
- Use async prep (shared notes, pre-reads) to save time in sync.
- Rotate facilitation in retros to build shared ownership.

## üîß Tools I Use

- **Jira**: For visualizing backlog status and story readiness.
- **Miro**: For retros, story mapping, and collaborative planning.
- **Confluence**: For documenting outcomes, agreements, and decisions.
- **Slack/Teams**: For async follow-ups and daily reminders.

## üìå Final Thought

A good meeting rhythm isn‚Äôt about more meetings ‚Äî it‚Äôs about the **right** conversations at the **right** time. My goal is to help teams focus on value, reduce friction, and continuously improve ‚Äî one sprint at a time.
