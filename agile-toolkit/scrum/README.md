# 🌀 Scrum – Framework in Practice

This folder reflects how I facilitate and adapt the Scrum framework in real-world, fast-paced environments. My approach is people-centered, metrics-aware, and delivery-focused. As a Scrum Master, I balance structure and flexibility to help teams build momentum, deliver value, and continuously improve.

Each file provides insight into how I work day-to-day with agile teams — through tooling, ceremonies, backlog management, and tracking meaningful outcomes.

## 💡 My Scrum Philosophy

- **Build rhythm, not pressure** – Sprints should enable momentum, not burnout
- **Prioritize clarity** – Teams move faster when work is visible and understood
- **Facilitate learning** – I coach teams to own their process and improve it
- **Adapt structure to context** – I tailor ceremonies and boards to what the team needs now

Scrum works best when it's both **structured and human**. My focus is to help teams feel confident, deliver consistently, and evolve together.
