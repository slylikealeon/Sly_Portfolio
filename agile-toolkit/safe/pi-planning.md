# 📅 Program Increment (PI) Planning – Enabling Alignment at Scale

**PI Planning** is a cornerstone of the SAFe framework. It brings together multiple teams, stakeholders, and leadership to align around a shared vision, establish sprint-level commitments, and uncover risks and dependencies across the Agile Release Train (ART).

As a Scrum Master, my role is to facilitate the preparation and execution of PI Planning, ensuring that teams enter with clarity and leave with confidence.

## 🎯 Objectives of PI Planning

- Align teams to a shared vision and prioritized backlog
- Commit to Sprint (Iteration) goals for the next 8–12 weeks
- Visualize and plan around cross-team dependencies
- Identify, surface, and resolve delivery risks
- Strengthen collaboration between business and tech

## 🧾 Pre-PI Preparation

I support preparation at multiple levels:

### With Product Owners:
- Refine Features for upcoming PI with clear acceptance criteria
- Split large features across teams (if needed)
- Prioritize Features using WSJF or business value
- Ensure Definition of Ready (DoR) is met for critical items

### With Teams:
- Review current capacity (team velocity, time-off, other commitments)
- Surface known technical dependencies or external blockers
- Ensure each team has a stable backlog for estimation and planning

### With Stakeholders:
- Clarify business goals and success metrics for the PI
- Identify high-level risks and alignment topics in advance
