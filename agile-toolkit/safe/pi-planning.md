# 📅 PI Planning – Facilitating Alignment at Scale

Program Increment (PI) Planning is the heartbeat of SAFe. It’s where strategy meets execution. As a Scrum Master, I play an active role in preparing, facilitating, and supporting teams through this critical event.

This document outlines how I approach PI Planning in scaled agile environments.

## 🧭 My Role Before, During & After PI Planning

| Phase          | What I Do                                                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Before**     | Prepare the team, stories, and context for confident planning     |
| **During**     | Facilitate participation, manage risks and dependencies           |
| **After**      | Support commitment, follow-up, and ensure execution starts strong |

## 📌 Preparation Phase (Before PI Planning)

### 🔹 1. Backlog Readiness
- Work with the PO to ensure high-priority features are broken into refined stories
- Validate stories meet Definition of Ready (DoR)
- Ensure dependencies are identified and documented
- Tag relevant stories by Feature, Epic, and ART-level initiative

### 🔹 2. Team Alignment
- Host pre-PI syncs to clarify business goals
- Share the PI Objectives draft early
- Review capacity planning (days off, team velocity, special events)

### 🔹 3. Tooling Setup
- Miro (or physical board) with team areas and feature swimlanes
- Jira boards pre-configured by sprint
- Dependency visualization (color-coded or mapped on a shared layer)

---

## 🏁 Execution Phase (During PI Planning)

### 🔹 1. Day 1 – Draft Planning
- Ensure team understands Feature context
- Facilitate breakout sessions (story estimation, capacity fit, sequencing)
- Visualize draft sprint plans on board (1–5 sprints)
- Surface cross-team dependencies and raise risks

### 🔹 2. Day 2 – Confidence Building
- Support in finalizing PI Objectives
- Facilitate the **ROAM** board:
  - **R**esolved
  - **O**wned
  - **A**ccepted
  - **M**itigated
- Run or support the **Confidence Vote**
- Coach teams on realistic commitments, not aspirational lists

## 🎯 Outputs of a Good PI Planning

- Committed **PI Objectives**, aligned with business priorities
- Defined stories distributed across 4–6 sprints
- Cross-team dependencies mapped and acknowledged
- Capacity allocation for:
  - Enablers
  - Maintenance
  - Innovation / IP sprint
- Shared visibility via roadmap (Jira, Miro, Confluence)

---

## 📊 Tools I Use

- **Jira (Advanced Roadmaps):** To link Features → Stories → Sprints
- **Miro:** Interactive board for visual planning and dependency tracking
- **Confluence:** PI Objective documentation and post-PI follow-up
- **Power BI / Jira Dashboards:** Track progress against PI commitments

## 🧠 Best Practices I Promote

| Practice                          | Why It Matters                                              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Story readiness review before PI | Prevents wasted planning time                                |
| Visual planning boards           | Improves understanding of interdependencies                  |
| Team-led planning (not top-down) | Builds ownership and realistic forecasts                     |
| Business participation           | Ensures alignment with real value streams and needs          |
| Inspect & Adapt follow-up        | Turns learnings into real change before next increment       |

## ✅ Final Thought

PI Planning isn’t just about filling sprints — it’s about creating **shared commitment**. My goal is to make it inclusive, realistic, and actionable. When done well, it gives every team member a clear direction and every stakeholder peace of mind.
