# 🔄 Cross-Team Coordination in SAFe

In scaled agile environments, delivering value often requires multiple teams to collaborate, integrate, and adapt together. As a Scrum Master operating within SAFe, I actively support cross-team coordination to manage dependencies, unblock delivery, and ensure alignment across Agile Release Trains (ARTs).

This document outlines how I help teams navigate complexity and stay connected.

## 🧭 My Role in Cross-Team Collaboration

- Facilitate and represent my team in **Scrum of Scrums** and **ART Syncs**
- Identify, visualize, and track cross-team **dependencies**
- Coordinate with other Scrum Masters and RTEs to align priorities
- Surface **risks and blockers** early to prevent last-minute surprises
- Promote shared ownership of integration and system-level goals

---

## 🧱 Key Coordination Events

### 🔹 Scrum of Scrums (SoS)
- Cadence: 1–2 times per week
- Participants: Scrum Masters (sometimes POs, Tech Leads)
- Focus:
  - What did we complete?
  - What’s coming next?
  - Are we blocked or blocking anyone?

> I come prepared with my team’s progress, dependency updates, and any risk signals to raise transparently.

---

### 🔹 ART Sync
- Broader alignment session that includes:
  - Scrum of Scrums
  - PO Sync
  - RTE coordination
- Topics include PI progress, strategic risks, and delivery planning

> I contribute to ART Syncs by surfacing systemic blockers and communicating team needs clearly to the train level.

## 🧩 Managing Dependencies

I proactively identify and manage dependencies by:

- Encouraging teams to **log and tag** dependencies in Jira
- Using **Jira Advanced Roadmaps** or Miro to map cross-team dependencies visually
- Facilitating conversations between dependent teams early in the PI
- Assigning **owners** and expected delivery dates to each dependency
- Tracking dependency status in sync meetings or Confluence dashboards

> I treat every dependency as a potential blocker and escalate proactively when ownership is unclear.

## ⚠️ Risk Management & the ROAM Technique

In planning sessions or ART Syncs, I facilitate the use of the **ROAM** board:

| Risk Type     | Action                         |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Resolved      | We’ve already addressed this   |
| Owned         | Someone is assigned to resolve |
| Accepted      | We acknowledge, will accept it |
| Mitigated     | We’ve reduced the impact       |

> I ensure each team updates their ROAM status as risks evolve and keep stakeholders informed.

## 🧠 Best Practices I Promote

| Practice                                  | Why It Matters                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visualizing dependencies early           | Reduces surprises and reactive planning                       |
| Dedicated syncs for integration work     | Ensures components come together before deadlines             |
| Clear ownership of dependencies          | Avoids ping-pong and confusion on responsibilities            |
| Soft escalation via SMs & RTE            | Encourages resolution before blockers reach team level        |
| Use of shared Confluence pages           | Keeps decisions and plans visible across teams                |

## 📊 Tools I Use

- **Jira (Advanced Roadmaps):** For mapping dependencies and linking between teams
- **Miro:** Shared dependency maps and planning boards
- **Confluence:** ROAM boards, shared agreements, coordination logs
- **Slack / Teams:** Async alignment and rapid updates across time zones

## ✅ Final Thought

Cross-team coordination is where agility either scales or collapses. My role is to make communication structured but lightweight — aligning moving parts without overwhelming the people moving them. I focus on visibility, trust, and shared rhythm to make collaboration feel seamless, not stressful.
