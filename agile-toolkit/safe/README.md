# 🚀 Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) – My Practice in Action

This folder showcases my hands-on approach to applying the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) in real-world delivery environments. As a Scrum Master and agile enabler, I support the alignment of multiple teams working toward shared objectives under the structure of Agile Release Trains (ARTs).

Each file here highlights a key domain of my SAFe experience, combining process facilitation, cross-team collaboration, tooling, and strategic alignment with business priorities.

## 📁 File Overview

### 🗓️ `pi-planning.md`
How I prepare, facilitate, and follow up on Program Increment (PI) Planning sessions. Covers backlog readiness, visual planning, confidence votes, ROAM board facilitation, and creating clear, deliverable-aligned PI Objectives. Includes tooling and rituals I use to make PI Planning valuable and inclusive.

### 🧱 `epic-management.md`
Describes how I help manage large-scale initiatives (Epics) through Lean Business Cases, WSJF prioritization, Portfolio Kanban, and decomposition into executable Features and Stories. I emphasize business alignment and visibility across delivery streams.

### 🔄 `cross-team-coordination.md`
Explains how I coordinate dependencies, unblock delivery, and foster collaboration across multiple teams. Includes my use of Scrum of Scrums, ART Syncs, dependency mapping, and risk management (ROAM). Also highlights how I use Jira and Miro for transparency.

### 🤝 `stakeholder-alignment.md`
Outlines my strategies to keep stakeholders (Demand Managers, Product Owners, PMs, executives) informed, engaged, and aligned. Includes cadence-based communication, system demos, real-time dashboards, and best practices for building trust between delivery and business.

## 🧠 My Approach to SAFe

I see SAFe as a powerful framework when applied with pragmatism and human focus. I prioritize:

- Clarity of purpose at all levels (epics → sprints)
- Facilitation over enforcement
- Making complexity visual and manageable
- Encouraging self-organization and shared accountability

My goal is to ensure that **strategy flows into execution** with visibility, alignment, and sustainable delivery across the board.
