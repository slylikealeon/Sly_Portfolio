# 🤝 Stakeholder Alignment in SAFe

One of the most critical success factors in scaled agile environments is ensuring continuous alignment between delivery teams and stakeholders. As a Scrum Master, I help build bridges between squads, Product Management, Demand Managers, and business leadership to foster shared goals, transparency, and trust.

This document outlines how I support alignment from planning through execution.

## 🎯 My Objectives

- Translate business goals into actionable team-level context
- Keep stakeholders informed of progress, risks, and changes
- Create regular feedback loops to validate priorities
- Ensure that Product Owners and Demand Managers stay empowered and connected to the teams

## 📌 Key Stakeholder Activities I Support

### 🔹 PI Planning Participation
- Invite stakeholders (PMs, BAs, Demand Managers) to observe team planning
- Help them express business objectives clearly
- Use story mapping and visual boards to show how value will be delivered

> I guide the team to ask clarifying questions and align their sprint planning to the business objectives.

---

### 🔹 Sprint Reviews & System Demos
- Organize meaningful reviews with real outcomes demonstrated
- Encourage stakeholders to attend regularly and give feedback
- Highlight what was delivered vs what was planned — transparently

> I coach teams to present stories in terms of user impact, not just technical work.

---

### 🔹 Confluence Hubs & Dashboards
- Create dedicated spaces for each ART or team:
  - PI Objectives
  - Committed features and stories
  - Current impediments and delivery risks
- Use Jira dashboards or Power BI to give real-time views of velocity, delivery confidence, and dependency status

## 🛑 Anti-Patterns I Address

| Issue                            | What I Do                                                         |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stakeholders "informed too late" | Set up lightweight weekly updates and visible dashboards          |
| Business goals not reflected     | Facilitate prioritization sessions to tie backlog to objectives   |
| Disconnect between PO & Demand   | Mediate clear roles and foster collaboration on prioritization    |

## 🧰 Tools I Use

- **Confluence:** Centralized space for documentation, PI status, and decisions
- **Jira Dashboards:** Custom widgets showing sprint progress, risk flags, velocity
- **Miro / FigJam:** For collaborative roadmap reviews or workshops
- **Power BI:** Executive reporting for PI-wide or portfolio-level metrics
- **Slack / MS Teams:** Async updates, stakeholder pings, and visibility threads

## ✅ Final Thought

Alignment isn’t about sending reports — it’s about creating **shared understanding** and **mutual confidence**. My approach focuses on communication rhythms, visual clarity, and human connection to ensure stakeholders never feel disconnected from delivery.
