# 🌱 Mentoring Practices – Enabling Growth in Agile Roles

Mentoring is a natural extension of my role as Scrum Master. Whether it’s onboarding a new PO, guiding a junior Scrum Master, or helping a developer grow into a more collaborative team member, I treat mentoring as a structured, intentional practice — not just casual advice.

This document outlines how I mentor individuals and create a culture of continuous learning within and across teams.

## 🧩 How I Structure Mentoring

### 🔹 1:1 Sessions
- Scheduled biweekly or monthly
- Set goals together (e.g., “Get confident in leading retros”)
- Use real scenarios to reflect and brainstorm solutions

### 🔹 Shadowing & Co-Facilitation
- Invite mentees to observe sprint ceremonies, workshops, or PI planning
- Co-lead retros or planning meetings, followed by debrief sessions

### 🔹 Feedback & Self-Reflection
- Use coaching cards or prompts (e.g., "What felt natural / what felt off?")
- Provide actionable feedback with specific examples
- Encourage self-assessment using agile maturity radars

### 🔹 Resource Sharing
- Curated Notion pages or Confluence spaces with:
  - Book summaries
  - Workshop templates
  - BDD examples, MoSCoW cheat sheets, facilitation guides
- Recommend communities of practice and agile meetups

## ✨ My Mentoring Mindset

- I listen before advising
- I support progress over perfection
- I treat mentoring as a two-way growth opportunity
- I celebrate small wins and mindset shifts, not just delivery milestones

## ✅ Final Thought

Mentoring helps scale agile beyond frameworks — by building **confidence, clarity, and community**. I strive to leave every mentee feeling more empowered, self-aware, and connected to their role and team.
