# 🧠 Team Health Checks – Measuring What Matters

A high-performing agile team is not just defined by its velocity — but by its **trust, clarity, collaboration, autonomy**, and ability to learn together. I regularly run structured **Team Health Checks** to assess and support those qualities, identify patterns, and co-create paths for improvement.

This document outlines how I facilitate and follow through on these team diagnostics.

## 🎯 Objectives of a Team Health Check

- Identify early signs of disengagement, friction, or burnout
- Promote self-awareness within the team
- Make psychological safety visible and actionable
- Adapt coaching and facilitation based on real team needs
- Foster continuous improvement beyond delivery metrics

---

## 🧪 Formats I Use

### 🔹 Atlassian Team Health Monitor
- Simple radar model covering areas like:
  - Shared understanding
  - Value delivery
  - Decision-making
  - Dependability
- Scored from “Green” to “Red” by the team
- Tracked every 6–8 weeks

> I facilitate the radar in a judgment-free setting, highlight trendlines, and co-create experiments for improvement.

---

### 🔹 Custom Agile Maturity Surveys
- Anonymous Google Forms or Miro voting boards
- Mix of quantitative (scale) and qualitative (comments) prompts:
  - “I understand how our work connects to company goals”
  - “We talk openly about issues without fear”
  - “We continuously improve our process as a team”

> I anonymize data, visualize results, and run a workshop to discuss insights constructively.

---

### 🔹 Emotional Retrospectives
- Used when team morale or trust needs special attention
- Activities include:
  - Team weather report 🌦️
  - Mad/Sad/Glad
  - Feedback rounds (“One thing I appreciate, one thing I need”)

> I help teams name emotions, not suppress them — and coach them to turn feedback into action.

## 📈 Post-Check Follow-Up

After each health check, I...

- Summarize results (visually and neutrally)
- Share findings in a retrospective or async channel
- Co-facilitate the creation of **experiments** or team working agreements
- Track impact over time via feedback or qualitative markers

> Example: “Let’s try reducing meeting time next sprint to give more focus space — and review how it felt during retro.”

## 🛠️ Tools I Use

- **Miro / Mural** – Health radars, interactive voting, emotion maps
- **Google Forms** – Anonymous surveys
- **Slack / Teams** – Follow-ups, async feedback loops
- **Confluence** – Trends tracker, action logs, team agreements

## 💡 My Coaching Stance

Health checks are not audits — they are opportunities to **listen**, **connect**, and **empower**. I create safe spaces where teams feel heard and supported, not judged.

As a coach, my focus is to help teams recognize their own strengths and frictions, and to take ownership of evolving as both **humans and collaborators**.
