# 🧑‍🏫 Agile Coaching & Mentoring – Building Teams Beyond Process

This folder reflects how I support teams and individuals beyond ceremonies and boards — by focusing on the **human side of agility**. Coaching, facilitation, and mentoring are central to how I help people thrive in their roles, navigate challenges, and grow together.

My approach is grounded in empathy, structure, and intentional development. Whether working with new team members, Product Owners, or fellow Scrum Masters, I focus on building clarity, trust, and ownership.

## 💡 Coaching Philosophy

I believe the best teams are not the ones with the most velocity — but those that trust each other, learn from mistakes, and grow with purpose.

As a coach, I focus on:

- Listening more than advising  
- Creating safe, structured spaces for growth  
- Helping teams own their process and culture  
- Supporting people to become more **adaptive**, not just more "agile"

Growth doesn’t happen by accident — it happens through reflection, feedback, and courageous conversations. That’s what this section is all about.
