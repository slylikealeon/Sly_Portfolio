# 🔁 Retrospective Facilitation – From Reflection to Action

Retrospectives are the heartbeat of continuous improvement. As a Scrum Master and agile coach, I design and facilitate retros that go beyond templates — making them safe, engaging, and tailored to each team's journey. My goal is to turn insights into real change, while also nurturing team connection.

---

## 🎯 What I Focus On

- Foster psychological safety and honest reflection
- Adapt the format to team maturity, context, and energy
- Balance emotional check-ins with actionable discussions
- Encourage experimentation and ownership of improvements
- Include space for team bonding and fun — even when remote

## 🧪 Retrospective Formats I Use

| Format                    | When I Use It                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Start / Stop / Continue  | For clarity and structured feedback            |
| 4Ls (Liked, Learned...)  | When learning is the key focus                 |
| "What Went Well / Not"   | For quick pulse checks                         |
| Mad/Sad/Glad             | To surface emotional tone                      |

> I often rotate formats to keep things fresh and avoid stagnation.

## 🎲 Team Building: Fun as a Ritual

At the start or end of retros, I frequently include **short games or interactive dynamics**, such as:

- 🎯 Icebreaker questions or "Guess the teammate"
- 🤹‍♂️ Virtual Pictionary or Skribbl.io
- 🎲 Geoguesser
- 🚀 “Two truths and a lie” (with a work twist)
- 💬 Story Cubes or word association rounds

> These small moments help the team **laugh, connect, and recharge**, especially if we’re fully remote or newly formed.

---

## 💬 Facilitation Techniques I Apply

- Use **silent brainstorming** before group discussion (e.g., in Miro or Jamboard)
- Encourage everyone to **vote** on most important items (Dot Voting)
- Keep track of recurring topics and improvements in **Confluence**
- Ensure each retro ends with **at least one experiment or commitment**
- Revisit past action items to ensure continuity and ownership

## 🧠 My Role in Retros

| What I Do                           | How It Helps                            |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Create psychological safety         | Enables honest and constructive dialogue |
| Read team energy and adapt on the fly| Keeps engagement and relevance high      |
| Stay neutral                        | Lets the team own the process            |
| Encourage follow-through            | Ensures retros lead to real change       |

## 🛠️ Tools I Use

- **Miro / Mural / FigJam** – For collaborative retro boards
- **EasyRetro** – Ready-to-use remote templates
- **Confluence** – Action item tracking, retro history
- **Slack / Teams** – Async retros or sharing retro outcomes / Breakout rooms for deeper group conversations

---

## 📆 Frequency & Rhythm

I hold retros **every sprint** and adjust the format based on:

- Team maturity
- Project tension or momentum
- Recent delivery or incidents
- Team feedback from previous retros

---

## ✅ Final Thought

Retrospectives are not just meetings — they are a **mirror** and a **lever**. My goal is to help teams reflect with depth, act with intent, and grow together — all while having a bit of fun along the way.
